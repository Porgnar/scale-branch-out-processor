Compile ncomp.c, and run it, you can edit format.c if you wish to change delimiters or need to adjust the formating of your lines.

Example way of running ncomp.c:

./ncomp /foo/.../SCALE_output.out /foo/.../existing_folder/filename

You should NOT give extensions with your filename, the program will automatically attach those to the output files!
It works this way because I wanted to practice how to do write a program capable of this, and for ease of inserting the identifiers of the two separate output files.
